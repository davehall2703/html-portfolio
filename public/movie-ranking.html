<h1>My 3 Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>David's top 3 movies of all time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Great acting, wonderous content with a great soundtrack.</p>
<h3>The Castle</h3>
<p>Hilarious Austrlian movie from late 90s. Classic Australian characters with heart-warming storyline.</p>
<h3>Casino Royale</h3>
<p>The first James Bond movie which got a bit more serious and sinister. Moved away from the corny, cheesey Pierce Brosnan era.</p>
